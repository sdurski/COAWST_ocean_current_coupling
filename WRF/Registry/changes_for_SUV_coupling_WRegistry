The only change that needed to be made for the ocean current coupling is to add writing of UOCE and VOCE to the Registry.EM_COMMON. To do so we just need to add an h in the 8th column of the row corresponding to the variables. 'i0124rhd' replaces 'i0124rd'

state    real   UOCE            ij     misc        1         -     i0124rhd=(interp_mask_water_field:lu_index,iswater)  "UOCE"  "SEA SURFACE ZONAL CURRENTS" "m s-1"
