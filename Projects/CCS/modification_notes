Step 1) Get the basic SST coupled CCS8 case to run.

New WRF balks at the nproc_x = 8, nproc_y = 14 partition setting saying that this resuls in less than 9 grid points in the y- direction for some tiles. 

**  in namelist.input
    Changed to nproc_x = 10, nproc_y = 11,  

Consistent with this 
** in coupling_ccs8.in
   Changed the number of Atm processes by 2.

New WRF no longer supports old input files that don't pre-calculate moist potential temperature
So either need to generate new input wrfinput_d0x and wrfbdy_d0x files or set 
** in namelist.input  
&dynamics 
   moist_adv_opt                       = 0
(people have complained in posts that they get worse performance without using moist potential temperature but this is what we will do for now.)

Version 4 of WRF by default uses a hybrid vertical coordinate system. THis needs to be turned off because it doesn't like the old input data ...it tries to check for it. The hybrid coordinate is the default now.

** in namelist.input
   %dynamics
    hybrid_opt = 0
...to be continued...

This has been a battle!
I also needed to link to different table files associated with the newer version of the code.

 In my working directory ...
