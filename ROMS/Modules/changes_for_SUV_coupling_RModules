Changes for implementing surface current coupling - Modules

I am adding basically two new global variables for ocean atmosphere surface current coupling. I have specified these as u_caw and v_caw (caw - couple air-water). In hindsight 'cao' is an option more consistent with the ice-ocean coupling variable names, but 'water' is more generic for the case of large lakes.

In order to add these two variables we add declarations, dimensioning and initialization of them in mod_ocean.F
We also define two time averaged versions of the variables (avgUcaw, avgVcaw) in mod_averages.F
